## Networking
- The VPC CNI provides native integration with AWS VPC and works in **underlay** mode. In underlay mode, Pods and hosts are located at the same network layer and share the network namespace. The IP address of the Pod is consistent from the cluster and VPC perspective.
- **CNI** : The CNI plugin is enabled by passing kubelet the --network-plugin=cni command-line option. Kubelet reads a file from --cni-conf-dir (default /etc/cni/net.d) and uses the CNI configuration from that file to set up each Podâ€™s network. The CNI configuration file must match the CNI specification (minimum v0.4.0) and any required CNI plugins referenced by the configuration must be present in the --cni-bin-dir directory (default /opt/cni/bin). If there are multiple CNI configuration files in the directory, the kubelet uses the configuration file that comes first by name in lexicographic order.
